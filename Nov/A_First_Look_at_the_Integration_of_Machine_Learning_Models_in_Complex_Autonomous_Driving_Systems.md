# A First Look at the Integration of Machine Learning Models in Complex Autonomous Driving Systems


## Motivation: Why I read this paper?
Currently, I am working on analyzing trustworthy AI systems with static analysis. In recent years, the research community has made significant breakthroughs in machine learning algorithms and practical application. But little work has been done on analysing the AI-powered system. I don't want to target at AI models (single module in a system) only. Instead, I want to proceed with this project from a systematic perspective. 

This paper takes a first look at the integration of machine learning models in the autonomous driving system, which is helpful for me to understand my project, e.g. the feasibility to analyzing a large-scale autonomous driving system.
