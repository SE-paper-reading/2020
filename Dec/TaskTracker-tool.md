# TaskTracker-tool: a Toolkit for Tracking of Code Snapshots and Activity Data During Solution of Programming Tasks

选这篇文章是因为我以前还没有认真读过Tool Demo的文章，这篇还同时是工业界(JetBrains)的，于是我觉得值得一读。

we present a set of tools for collecting and processing data of student activity during problem-solving

这文章还和education有关

主要是提到了2个tools:

- A plugin for IntelliJ-based IDEs. By capturing snapshots of code and IDE interaction data, it allows to analyze the process of writing code in different languages — Python, Java, Kotlin, and C++.
- designed for the post-processing of data collected by the plugin and is capable of basic analysis and visualization

records of activity and IDE interaction events during solution of programming tasks by 148 participants of different ages and levels of programming experience

programming eduction听上去也很有趣

make tracking and analysis of students’ coding behavior a promising technique for educational research

Our intention was to create a tool capable of collecting all consecutive code snapshots and user actions during the solution of a programming task in various programming languages.

The main purpose of TaskTracker-tool is to collect all code changes and IDE actions that happen during the process of solving programming assignments
